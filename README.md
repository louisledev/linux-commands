# Linux Commands
This repo aims to list the set of Linux commands that helped me in my work life.

## lsof
The `lsof` lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes. 

An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.) A specific file or all the files in a file system may be selected by path.

See [Man Page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsof), [Tutorial](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-lsof-command/)
